\section{Emerald and the Emerald VM}

Emerald is a general-purpose programming language, designed in the
early 1980s, in an academic effort to address the challenge of
programming distributed systems. This effort culminated in numerous
academic publications\cite{emerald:tse:1987, emerald:tocs:1988,
emerald:spe:1991} and PhD theses\cite{emerald:phd:norman-c-hutchinson,
emerald:phd:eric-jul, emerald:phd:niels-christian-juul}. However, over
time, Emerald has gained practically no ground as the programming
language of choice for distributed systems enthusiasts and
professionals.
