\section{Emerald and the Emerald VM}

Emerald is a general-purpose programming language, designed in the
early 1980s, in an academic effort to address the challenge of
programming distributed systems. This effort culminated in numerous
academic publications\cite{emerald:tse:1987, emerald:tocs:1988,
emerald:spe:1991} and PhD theses\cite{emerald:phd:norman-c-hutchinson,
emerald:phd:eric-jul, emerald:phd:niels-christian-juul}. However,
Emerald has gained little ground as a programming language --- it
remains only narrowly used in small, academic circles. As such, the
elements of the Emerald programming environment are sometimes flaky,
and only piecewise well-documented.

Emerald programs are compiled into bytecode for an Emerald-specific
virtual machine (also called a ``kernel''\cite{emerald:phd:eric-jul}).
The Emerald VM was crafted around the same time as Emerald itself.
Unlike the Emerald programming model, it has received less academic
scrutiny. Chances are, the Emerald VM is severely outdated, and it is
no match for a more modern VM targeting distributed systems. This
claim is investigated throughout the rest of this report.
